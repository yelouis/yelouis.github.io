          <p>Hi, my name is Louis Ye. I am a Computer Science Research Assistant at

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I started as self-taught programmer and expanded my computer science knowledge through my education. This has lead to multiple software internships where I utilized the fundamental data structures and algorithms I’ve studied to quickly put my knowledge into practice. My experiences has helped me develop the instinct to quickly adapt in any role and environment. Inside the classroom, I have coded in Java and Python on projects such as neural networks and RSA Cryptography, and outside the classroom, I have coded in Swift, HTML, CSS, and Javascript on projects such as app development and web development. While all of these projects were advance topics, I’ve always jumped into the unknown with enthusiasm because at the end of each project, I’ll be more knowledgeable in another field. I am currently a computer science researcher assistant at Carleton College running behavioral experiments and data analysis about fraction arithmetic and the study about coding style using Inverse Reinforcement Learning Algorithm.</p>
        <h2>Professional Inquiries</h2>
